// Claude exact-session history reader: the single built-in decoder subset `nativeEntriesSubsetV2`
// (lossless restart Phase 4, phase4-plan §D and its native-history amendment).
//
// "V2" versions OUR decoder subset, not Claude's format or CLI (V1 = before the Step 4d2 attachment,
// envelope-proof and prefix-fence predicates; V1 baselines are kept as recorded and never upgraded). Shapes follow the pinned official
// Python SDK fixtures (`claude-agent-sdk-python@3cb0c27eca8caccdc153471a1b19f97fce4ada03`,
// `tests/test_sessions.py` `_make_transcript_entry` / `_parallel_tool_turn`, and
// `_internal/sessions.py` `_build_conversation_chain` / `_recover_orphaned_parallel_tool_results`).
// That pin is reproducibility evidence, not an accepted CLI version or live qualification.
//
// Contract:
// - Exact session only: `<known projects dir>/<project>/<sessionID>.jsonl`. No match = unavailable;
//   more than one distinct file = ambiguous (never chosen by timestamp).
// - Absence is verified, never inferred from a failure: every authorized root must be enumerated
//   (a missing root is genuinely empty) and every listed candidate must report its identity.
//   Anything else is `inspectionFailed`, so a baseline is never `file: nil` because a directory
//   or candidate was unreadable.
// - One descriptor: identity (device, inode, birth time) and bytes come from the same open file.
// - Only complete lines are decoded; an incomplete trailing line waits (an import). A baseline
//   refuses non-whitespace bytes after the last newline (`partialTrailingRecord`): that pre-existing
//   record would otherwise look like a post-baseline entry later. The ENTIRE captured complete
//   candidate is validated before any row, cursor or ledger suppression is produced: an unsupported
//   entry type (including `file-history-snapshot`, `progress`, `system`), an attachment outside the
//   exact whitelist, an operational record carrying graph identity, unsupported content block
//   (thinking included), meaningful metadata (sidechain, meta, compaction, team/agent), a documented
//   retraction marker (`supersedes`, `aborted`, `retracted_message_uuids`), malformed line, session
//   mismatch, conflicting duplicate, missing parent, cycle, ambiguous branch, or ambiguous tool
//   association rejects the whole candidate.
// - Capture-qualified nonrendering nodes (Step 4d2, phase4d-claude-capture O19, CLI 2.1.302): the
//   exact observed `attachment.type` values are graph nodes that are never projected; only their
//   `uuid`/`parentUuid`/`sessionId` structure (and top-level metadata) is read, never their payload.
//   The exact observed operational record types carry no graph identity and are skipped unread
//   (any `uuid`/`parentUuid` key on one refuses). This qualifies a visible projection of that
//   observed shape only, not the native format, other attachment kinds, or activation.
// - Step 4d4 (phase4d-tool-resume-capture O20): one exact `mode` record is skipped as nonprojected
//   metadata only when it is precisely `{type:"mode", mode:"normal", sessionId:<this session>}`;
//   any other key (graph ID keys included, even null), mode value, or session refuses. `mode` is
//   deliberately not an operational type. Successful single-Read tool exchanges across a
//   same-session resume project through the existing tool association unchanged.
// - Attachment-only side branches carry no message and never count as a continuation; a branch
//   whose subtree holds any message still does. A direct chain projects in ancestor order (block
//   ordinals unchanged); a demonstrated tool fork keeps file order.
// - Every row carries its entry's complete-envelope digest. Before any ledger suppression, every
//   ledger-known entry must be present with exactly its observed row keys and the same digest;
//   otherwise the whole candidate refuses (`ledgerConflict`).
// - Byte-prefix fences (Step 4d2): every candidate carries the SHA-256 of its exact captured raw
//   bytes `[0, completeLineOffset)` (opaque integrity, unrelated to the semantic envelope digest).
//   The import boundary and every caller-supplied fence (the attempt's baselines, the latest
//   durably saved import target) are verified against the SAME captured buffer: complete boundary,
//   length at least the offset, exact digest. A missing or malformed proof refuses
//   (`prefixProofUnavailable`); truncation or any different prefix refuses (`rewrittenHistory`),
//   same inode or not. A replaced file is accepted only when every fence verifies byte-for-byte;
//   there is no rewind or ledger-based fallback. No entry before the boundary may descend from one
//   after it (`rewrittenHistory`).
// - Parent links come from `parentUuid` only (never `logicalParentUuid`). Branching is accepted only
//   for the demonstrated parallel-tool shape: an assistant tool-use entry may have one continuation
//   child plus tool-result entries associated to it by `tool_use_id` and `sourceToolAssistantUUID`.
//   Shared API `message.id` only groups parallel calls; it is never an identity or dedup key.
// - Rows are inert data with deterministic identities derived from (provider, native session,
//   native entry UUID, row kind, block ordinal). Native user rows are validated but never
//   projected: `localItemID == nil` means unassociated/not projected, NOT proven RepoPrompt input.
//   The only evidence relating a native user entry to local items is an exact match with the
//   attempt's recorded outbound claims (`userMessageEntries`, matched by
//   `AgentProviderHistoryAssociationPreflight`); live stream output has none, and canonical import
//   refuses rather than assume one.
// - Completion is always unconfirmed: no final answer, stop reason, or EOF proves a turn finished.
// - Import needs a cursor (a baseline or an earlier import): rows are produced only after it.
