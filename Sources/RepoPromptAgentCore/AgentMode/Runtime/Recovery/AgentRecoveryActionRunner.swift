// Lossless restart Phase 4 explicit recovery actions (phase4-plan "Durable action association",
// "Restart join", and the activation gates). One runner per window performs each user choice as:
//
//   gate (qualification AND active Phase 3 registration AND the target's provider qualified,
//         with a history performer when the choice reconciles)
//   → durable reservation (idempotent: a repeated click joins, never re-performs)
//   → history-only reconciliation (Reconcile, and R7 step 2 before every continuation when
//     history reconciliation is qualified)
//   → stop without sending when verified terminal evidence bound to the source run attempt shows
//     the interrupted turn finished (R7 step 3)
//   → fence (lane still valid for handoff)
//   → the EXISTING normal dispatch, exactly once
//   → durable outcome.
//
// Crash uncertainty never auto-sends: only a reservation committed by this very call may dispatch.
// A reservation found already present (a repeat after the first performance ended) is joined to the
// record and reported, never performed again. A previous launch's open action on the item is joined
// and returned typed (`priorAction`); only an explicit new choice naming it may replace it.
