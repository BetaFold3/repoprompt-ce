// Queue identity and shared dispatch-evidence contracts for lossless app restart (Phase 1b).
//
// Every queued user input (generic follow-up, Claude and ACP steering, Codex fallback) carries an
// `AgentQueuedInputIdentity`: the transcript user item it belongs to and, when durable, the
// store-issued queue receipt naming its recovery intent. Untracked (legacy) identities exist only
// while the session's admission mode is `.inactive`; once activation sets `.mandatory`, they can no
// longer be constructed and a dispatch of one is refused, so activation cannot silently bypass
// durable admission.
//
// Provider workers use one two-step dispatch contract:
// 1. Before handoff: `AgentRecoveryDispatchEvidence.begin(...)` (async) commits `dispatching` plus
//    one attempt per constituent. No store gate is held across the provider call that follows.
// 2. After every await, the caller re-runs its own synchronous runtime freshness checks (session,
//    run ownership, controller) and, immediately before the provider boundary, the lane check
//    `isValidForHandoff(in:)` (the issuing lane is still the session's, unretired and not frozen by
//    reset preparation). If stale, it reports `noteNoHandoff` (the same intent returns to `queued`)
//    and does not hand off. A commit that lands on a retired or frozen lane is already settled and
//    refused by the lane (`dispatchStaleAfterCommit`).
// 3. After handoff: exactly the evidence the provider boundary proves — `noteAccepted`,
//    `noteDeliveryUnknown`, or `noteRejected` (verified rejection). `didSend`, fallback reasons,
//    transport creation, and cancelled responses are not acceptance.
