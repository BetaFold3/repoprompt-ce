// Step 9-activation-b: Check and resolve confirms a crash hold ("Sending paused") from process
// records, never from an empty registry. The proof (all must hold):
//   (a) checks are active and the registry is healthy: started, no storage failure, no unidentified
//       record, no unreadable record naming the session or what it touches;
//   (b) the hold consists of run attempts only (no uncertain intent, no legacy turn), each carrying
//       the run-start registration mark (`AgentRecoveryRunAttempt.recordedRuntimeRegistrationRaw`);
//   (c) each held attempt is named by an earlier-launch registry record;
//   (d) no earlier-launch record that names the session (any incarnation), names no session, or
//       shares one of its conversations or worktrees is still possibly running (`.exited` and
//       `.stopped` only; `.stopped` is written only after a fresh complete inventory shows no member
//       of the family alive, `AgentProcessRegistry.stop`);
//   (e) the adopted restriction snapshot agrees (no global uncertainty, no send restriction);
//   (f) the hold and its card are unchanged, nothing else acts on the session, Check isn't stopped.
// (a)-(d) come from one registry query (its records never leave `.exited`/`.stopped`, so the
// answer can't go stale); (b) is read before it; (e) and (f) are re-checked after it and before
// every commit attempt, and the card is checked again atomically with the write (the store refuses
// a card dismissed meanwhile). The only write is the exact crash-hold acknowledgement "It stopped"
// writes: through the session's live lane when one is open, otherwise under the closed-session gate
// (the session is never opened). Publication after the commit is shared with "It stopped"
// (`publishCrashHoldConfirmation`).
