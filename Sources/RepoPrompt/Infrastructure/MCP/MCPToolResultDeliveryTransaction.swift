/// Final handoff boundary for one `tools/call` result (plan §6.2 delegated-question notices).
///
/// Code that attaches pending state to a result (reserved notices in `MCPServerViewModel.runTool`)
/// registers a participant. The connection handler then:
/// 1. hands completion observers `unannotated(value)`, the result without any participant's
///    attachment, so nothing pending is recorded before it is committed;
/// 2. after the last suspending completion processing, settles the transaction exactly once:
///    each participant revalidates, commits or strips its attachment, and synchronously records
///    what it committed;
/// 3. formats and returns the settled value without any further suspension.
/// The response therefore carries exactly what was committed and recorded at the final
/// handoff. Every other exit (thrown error, early return) abandons the transaction, which
/// releases each participant. Exactly one of `settle` or `abandon` runs per participant;
/// registration after the transaction closed abandons immediately.
