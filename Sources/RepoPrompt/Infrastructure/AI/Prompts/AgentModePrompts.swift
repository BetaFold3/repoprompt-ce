        **When to dispatch an explore agent** (`agent_run` with `model_id="explore"`) — reach for one when a side investigation would flood your context with searches, logs, or file contents you won't reference again. The child does that work in its own session and returns only the summary. Good fits:
        - Tasks that need web search, external documentation lookup, or other information retrieval
        - Git history or archaeology — blame walks, log archaeology, "when did this change and why" questions
        - Searches where you're not confident you'll find the right match on the first try — fan out parallel probes on different guesses
        - Quick "how is X wired?" / "where does Y come from?" questions in code you don't know well — one focused probe per question

        **Skip delegation for small tasks.** If you already know the file or function to look at, inline `read_file` / `file_search` is faster and cheaper than a dispatched probe.

        Dispatch proactively otherwise — don't wait to be asked.

        **Keep each probe concise and answerable** so it finishes quickly. The first message starts a fresh context, so make it self-contained: state one specific question, name the files or areas to check, and say what kind of output you want back. If you need broader coverage, dispatch several narrow probes in parallel (one `agent_run op=start` call each with `detach: true`, then `wait` on the session_ids batch) rather than sending one sprawling brief — explore agents return tighter answers faster when scope is narrow.

        For a single probe, wait inline. For a fan-out, always pair `detach: true` with an explicit follow-up `wait` on the session_ids — never leave a detached probe unattended or it becomes a dangling agent. Use `pair` instead when the work needs multi-step reasoning with real back-and-forth, or `design` when the task calls for architectural thinking, design critique, or creative problem-solving.

        **After a probe returns**, treat its summary as a report of what it intended to do, not a trace of what it actually saw. Spot-check load-bearing claims with your own `read_file` / `file_search` / `git` before acting on them — especially file:line references or "X doesn't exist" findings. If the answer is thin or ambiguous, `steer` the same session with a narrow follow-up question rather than re-doing the investigation yourself — the child keeps its context and can dig deeper from where it left off.

        **When to dispatch an explore probe** (`agent_explore`) — reach for one when a side investigation would flood your context with searches, logs, or file contents you won't reference again. The probe does that work in its own session and returns only the summary. Good fits:
        - Tasks that need web search, external documentation lookup, or other information retrieval
        - Git history or archaeology — blame walks, log archaeology, "when did this change and why" questions
        - Searches where you're not confident you'll find the right match on the first try — fan out parallel probes on different guesses
        - Quick "how is X wired?" / "where does Y come from?" questions in code you don't know well — one focused probe per question

        **Skip delegation for small tasks.** If you already know the file or function to look at, inline `read_file` / `file_search` is faster and cheaper than a dispatched probe.

        Dispatch proactively otherwise — don't wait to be asked.

        **Keep each probe concise and answerable** so it finishes quickly. Each child is stateless, so the prompt must be self-contained: state one specific question, name the files or areas to check, and say what kind of output you want back. If you need broader coverage, pass several narrow prompts via `messages` in a single `start` call rather than sending one sprawling brief — explore probes return tighter answers faster when scope is narrow. A batched `start` returns when the first probe finishes; follow up with `wait` on the remaining session_ids to collect the rest.

        Always collect every probe's result — never `detach: true` without a follow-up `wait`. Detached probes left unattended become dangling agents.

        **After a probe returns**, treat its summary as a report of what it intended to do, not a trace of what it actually saw. Spot-check load-bearing claims with your own `read_file` / `file_search` / `git` before acting on them — especially file:line references or "X doesn't exist" findings. If the answer is thin or ambiguous, dispatch a narrow follow-up probe rather than re-doing the investigation yourself.
