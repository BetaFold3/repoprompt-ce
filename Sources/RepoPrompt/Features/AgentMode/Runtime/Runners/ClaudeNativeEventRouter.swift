/// Single long-lived consumer of one Claude native controller events stream.
///
/// A Claude process outlives the user-triggered run that started it: after a successful
/// result the CLI can resume on its own (for example when a background task finishes) and
/// keep emitting output. The router keeps reading that stream between runs so received
/// output reaches the transcript immediately instead of waiting for the next user send.
///
/// Every event belongs to the run that was current when the controller emitted it, never to
/// whichever run happens to be consuming when it is dispatched. A run becomes current at its
/// in-band `.marker(attemptID)`, which the runner asks the controller to emit just before
/// sending the run's message; runtimes without markers fall back to the moment the run
/// resolves its start. One processor dispatches strictly in stream order:
/// - an event owned by the consuming run goes to that run's handler;
/// - an event owned by a run whose runner task is alive and not yet released (starting,
///   sending, or finalizing) waits for that run;
/// - an event owned by no live run is between-run output and goes to the idle handler, even if
///   a newer run is already consuming. It is never handled as the newer run's output.
/// - An approval request is never handled idle while the stream is live: it waits, with
///   everything after it, for the next consuming run, which owns approval state. A request
///   cancelled before any run saw it is dropped together with its cancellation, a cancellation
///   follows the run that received its request, and a request still held when the stream ends
///   goes to the idle handler, which discards it with the dead process.
///
/// The stream is never iterated by more than one task, and a run's cancellation never cancels
/// the stream's iterator (which would terminate the stream for every later run).
