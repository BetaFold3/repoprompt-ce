// Lossless-restart Step 5a (docs/context/plans/2026-10-18-lossless-app-restart-spec.md, Phase 5):
// ordinary pending `apply_edits` reviews of a recovery-tracked Agent Mode session.
//
// - The owner (the reviewing tab's session, its exact recovery lane, the lane's binding, and the
//   session's existing ownership identity), and whether recovery is required, are frozen
//   synchronously before the review's first new await (target resolution, preview, ticket). The
//   review's identity then comes from the approval store's ticket; admission validates the frozen
//   owner and never adopts a replacement or falls back to untracked after an await.
// - The persisted target is the canonical absolute file the preview read and the reviewed write
//   uses (resolved once by the provider's workspace host), never a relative or alias string.
// - The exact proposal (proposed text, displayed diff, physical and display paths, owner, and the
//   preview's decoded-text base evidence) is committed `pending` before the live review is shown.
//   A refused or failed commit shows nothing and writes nothing.
// - On accept, `applicationStarted` is committed before the existing live host write begins; a
//   refusal there writes nothing (the proposal reverts to `pending`, best effort).
// - The fence (same session object in the tab with the same existing ownership identity: binding,
//   binding transition generation, persistence state, lane, parent; no binding transition in
//   progress; the same lane and lifecycle binding, valid for handoff, owned; not shutdown-frozen)
//   and Task cancellation are re-checked after every new await. After `applicationStarted`, the
//   exact review ticket is re-checked at the approval store, then the fence again synchronously
//   before the write. A replacement session is never silently bound; no lock is held while the
//   user decides.
// - A completed write removes the proposal (`applied`); if that record write fails the caller
//   reports partial success, never "nothing changed". An explicit reject withdraws it. Timeout and
//   every lifecycle cancellation keep it as history: the recovery list then offers only View,
//   Copy, and Discard. Nothing is ever applied from history.
// - An independent caller (no Agent Mode tab) or a session without durable recovery admission is
//   unchanged (no record is written).
