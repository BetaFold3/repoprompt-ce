// Lossless-restart Step 5b (docs/context/plans/2026-10-18-lossless-app-restart-spec.md, Phase 5):
// durable parent → child linkage for a routed `agent_run.start`, committed before the child's
// first dispatch.
//
// - Admission freezes, synchronously with the existing delegation admission, the dispatcher's
//   server-side MCP invocation UUID (local execution identity, never provider tool-use identity and
//   never a cross-request deduplication key), the admitted parent identity, its full active run
//   ownership (attempt captured once; never rebound), and its exact recovery lane.
// - Every later boundary re-checks the existing fences: the parent tab still holds that session,
//   the same attempt is current for the current binding, the same lane is valid for handoff
//   (not retired, reset-frozen, or shutdown-frozen), and the existing delegation commit check.
// - The child's identity, binding, and parent field are proven durable by a covering `.written`
//   owner save before the link is committed; the link commit is acknowledged before any child
//   dispatch. A failure before handoff dispatches nothing; a committed link may remain unused and
//   is never replayed.
// - The child's existing ownership facts (owner object, persistent binding and its transition
//   generation, persistence state with its transcript-reset generation, and recovery lane) are
//   captured after that covering save and re-checked after the link await and in every final
//   dispatch predicate. Only the creator's own first save may acquire persistence state and a lane;
//   a child reset, rebind, or replacement afterwards dispatches nothing.
// - Task cancellation is rejected after each new persistence await, before the start, and at the
//   final pre-dispatch fences. The owned Codex bounded-ack submission driver is unchanged: it keeps
//   the captured fence's state checks and is never cancelled after it marks its operation started.
// - The scoped fence is released once the start returns or throws, so unstructured work that
//   inherited it no longer arms it.
// - An independent MCP caller (no routed parent) and a parent without durable recovery admission
//   are unchanged.

/// One routed `agent_run.start` admitted under a recovery-tracked parent run attempt.
