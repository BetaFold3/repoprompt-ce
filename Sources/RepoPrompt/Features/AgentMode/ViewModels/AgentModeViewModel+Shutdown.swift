// - `beginShutdownFreeze` (synchronous, before any await): refuses new input, dispatch commits,
//   handoff, question answers, and binding changes for this window's sessions only.
// - `prepareSessionsForShutdown` (Stage A, reversible): joins composer work, preserves composers,
//   writes pending-question snapshots and run shutdown reasons, and flushes fully hydrated dirty
//   transcripts. Nothing irreversible happens; a failure leaves every session usable.
// - `endShutdownFreeze` (Stage A cancelled or failed): reopens admission.
// - `prepareForWindowClose(reason:)` (Stage B, irreversible, joinable, runs once).
// - `finalizeTranscriptsAfterShutdown` (Stage B, after the actual stop and terminal commit).
