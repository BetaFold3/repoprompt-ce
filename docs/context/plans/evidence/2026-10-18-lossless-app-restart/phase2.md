# Phase 2 remaining implementation evidence

Scope: read when the task touches the Phase 2 implementation of typed terminal causes, normal-operation question persistence, schema-8 recovery hints, durable card acknowledgement (Dismiss), or the shared recovery catalog, banner, and Needs Attention sheet.
Authority: Reference
Last-verified: 2026-10-21

Worker evidence for the adopted Oracle plan (`prompt-exports/oracle-plan-2026-10-21-185049-restart-phase2-remai-ba7b.md`, main's override of its §4) on baseline `57e451205ecded20a42b3ce1b61834ebd514cbac` (R4). R4 architecture is preserved: sealed admission, per-VM preparation serialization, absolute deadline, question ownership, secret veto, receipts, crash holds, and the scheduler. Nothing is staged or committed. The initial implementation was reviewed and not approved; its fixes were re-reviewed in R1, and the R1 fixes were re-reviewed in R2 (the last normal round, now exhausted). The post-cap fixes below were not re-reviewed; main is asking the owner how to close the capped review. Main owns the review, signing, the original plan's status and Decisions, and `phase2-plan.md`. O3 live acceptance remains pending.

## Initial independent reviews

[OracleA](phase2-oraclea.md) and [OracleB](phase2-oracleb.md) reviewed frozen tree `923f69a840be1fc0e297e8eb80dade18c1ecec92` independently with the same source and validation packet. Both preset identities were verified before synthesis. Answer-preservation ordering, native creation ownership, terminal reconciliation, live/closed catalog discovery and provider-loss attribution require fixes before re-review. Initial implementation is not approved.

## First re-review

[OracleA R1](phase2-oraclea-r1.md) and [OracleB R1](phase2-oracleb-r1.md) reviewed snapshot `0cabecc5cb118849e687f097782d226109d6eb3f`; both identities were verified. Required hand-over preservation and durable tail-warning findings remain open; mid-turn steering requires verification and repair. The coupled worker is addressing these before the second and final ordinary re-review. No findings were downgraded by main.

## Second re-review

[OracleA R2](phase2-oraclea-r2.md) and [OracleB R2](phase2-oracleb-r2.md) reviewed snapshot `70ee3c8bdb05a833bb4fb826d72ae7c9616c3040`; identities were verified. Earlier required findings closed. OracleA found a new P1: unscoped interruption after finalization can cancel a replacement Codex turn. Main inspected and accepted it; the bounded fix and the cheap never-published-question hand-over fix are underway. The normal review limit is exhausted. Main asked the owner whether to validate/checkpoint without another review (recommended), authorize one extra paired round, or pause after fixing. No extra review is authorized by the earlier Phase 1b-only O7 decision. The owner question timed out after 301 seconds without an answer. Main proceeds on the reversible recommended assumption: fix, validate and checkpoint without another review, explicitly disclosing that the final fix is not re-reviewed. This is not an Owner Decision.

## Post-cap fix dispositions (after R2; worker evidence, not a review, not re-reviewed)

Inputs: `prompt-exports/oracle-review-2026-10-21-225905-restart-phase2-r2-or-82b6.md` (open P1 F11-R2, confirmed by main at `failCodexRunForUnsavedQuestion`) and `prompt-exports/oracle-review-2026-10-21-230025-restart-phase2-r2-or-7575.md` (no P0/P1; P2 R2-F1). Both were read in full. Scope is limited to these two findings. P3 items R2-P3-a through R2-P3-e are not addressed.

### Lane: OracleA-r2 export `82b6`

| Finding | Disposition | Anchors |
|---|---|---|
| F11-R2 (P1): the deferred interrupt could cancel a replacement Codex turn | **Fixed (bounded, reversible).** The failed turn's exact identity is pinned before finalization releases the run, synchronously after admission returns `persistenceFailed` while the same run still holds the session. It is the asking request's own `turnID`, else the authoritative turn of this exact run attempt (run ID and attempt checked). After finalization, only that turn is interrupted, through `interruptUserTurn(expectedTurnID:)` on the run's own captured controller. That call is turn-scoped: the real controller refuses unless its authoritative turn matches, and it sends `turnId`. The unscoped `reconcileAndInterruptCurrentTurn()` fallback is removed. With no known identity nothing is interrupted, and the failure stays visible. There is no new transport API and no resolution await, so no post-await revalidation is needed. | `Codex/CodexAgentModeCoordinator.swift` `failCodexRunForUnsavedQuestion` :7179–7194, `failedQuestionTurnID(askingTurnID:session:)` :7198, call sites :7383, :7424; test `CodexAgentModeCoordinatorLivenessTests.testUnsavedQuestionFailureInterruptsOnlyTheAskingTurnWhenAReplacementStartsDuringFinalization` (:1228). The test covers both kinds, with the asking turn known and with no identity at all. A replacement run attempt (new run ID and attempt, authoritative `replacement-turn`) starts inside finalization, through the barrier's terminal-publication seam after the failed attempt ended, with no authoritative turn initially. The test asserts the replacement keeps running, the failure is visible, the interrupt is exactly `["asking-turn"]` or `[]`, and the unscoped interrupt count is 0. The creation-failure and hand-over tests now assert the exact interrupt `["turn"]` and no unscoped interrupt. |

### Lane: OracleB-r2 export `7575`

| Finding | Disposition | Anchors |
|---|---|---|
| R2-F1 (P2): an in-flight question creation was handed over as live | **Fixed.** `liveSnapshots` hands over only interactions whose creation committed. A committed question's pending or in-flight draft still wins, so R1-F3 coverage is kept. A creation still in flight was never published, so it is not adopted, which restores the disclosed historical "Expired question" behaviour for that race. | `Recovery/AgentRecoveryQuestionPersistenceController.swift` `liveSnapshots` :137. Tests: `CodexAgentModeCoordinatorLivenessTests.testSuccessorClaimAdoptsCommittedQuestionDraftButNotAnInFlightCreation` (:1405), plus a real-successor-claim variant of `testNativeQuestionLaneHandOverDuringCreationFailsTheRunLoudlyAndInterruptsTheProvider` (:1336, `LaneHandOver.release` and `.successorClaim`, both kinds). The first is an actual same-owner `claimLane` hand-over: the committed question's held, unsaved draft is adopted as pending and written durably by the successor after retirement, and the in-flight creation is never live in the successor. The claim variant asserts the successor never lists the request as live. |

Test support: `RecoveryLaneFixture.relocatedPersistenceState()` / `claimSuccessor(persistenceState:)` (`Tests/RepoPromptTests/AgentMode/Recovery/AgentQueuedInputTestSupport.swift` :83, :89). They produce a same-owner, same-binding, different-persistence-state claim by loading the same incarnation from a copied session file in another storage folder of the same workspace, using the same service. The state is loaded before any write is held, because loading takes the session persistence gate.

### Post-cap limitations

- If neither the request nor the run's authoritative turn has a turn ID, the failed provider turn is not interrupted. It may keep waiting on the unanswered server request until the provider ends it.
- The relocated-file claim is a constructed path to the ownership-preserving branch, not a production storage-relocation flow.
- I did not run either new regression against the pre-fix source. The expected failures are reasoned from the code only: the old fallback calls `cancelCurrentTurn` on the fake, and the old `liveSnapshots` adopts the in-flight creation.
- P3 items R2-P3-a to R2-P3-e are deferred: the wording on a saved-but-handed-over creation, span re-close breadth and `hadError`, attempt-less schedules needing Open, and fixture-only mid-turn coverage.

### Post-cap validation

| `make dev-lint` | f0d7ab00-e736-4288-805e-51976351b08b | pass |

- No separate `make dev-swift-build` was run. The changed sources are in `RepoPromptAgentCore` and were compiled by the `dev-test` builds.
- No source edit followed this validation.
- Not run: other suites, a full-root campaign, the visible app, real providers, and O3.
- No agents were started, and nothing was deleted, staged or committed.

## R1 fix dispositions (worker evidence on one delta over `0cabecc5`; not a review)

Inputs: `prompt-exports/oracle-review-2026-10-21-222538-restart-phase2-r1-or-ef0b.md` (lane A) and `prompt-exports/oracle-review-2026-10-21-222741-restart-phase2-r1-or-d9a0.md` (lane B), both read in full. No finding was downgraded. Architecture is unchanged: no new store, schema framework, catalog, tool or diagnostic framework. Paths are under `Sources/RepoPromptAgentCore/AgentMode/Runtime/` unless stated.

### Lane A

| Finding | Disposition | Anchors |
|---|---|---|
| A F01-R1 | **Fixed.** Handed-over live snapshots are adopted as *pending* (never as committed), and the successor's first write is ordered after the predecessor's retirement by a gate task inserted into the serialized `operationTail`. `liveSnapshots` includes in-flight upserts. A reply is allowed only once the successor's own write commits the answer: an early bounded wait times out, a failed retirement and failing writes return `.failed`, and the successor writes nothing before retirement ends. Known-live and non-secret semantics are unchanged. | `Recovery/AgentRecoveryQuestionPersistenceController.swift` (`inFlightUpserts` :64, `adoptLiveInteractions(_:after:)` :243, `writePending`); `Recovery/AgentRecoveryCoordinator.swift` `claimLane` :1125; tests `AgentRecoveryQuestionPersistenceTests.testHandedOverUnsavedAnswerIsNotRepliedUntilTheSuccessorPreservesItAfterRetirement` (:329, new) and `testSuccessorAdoptsOnlyStillLiveInteractionsAndKeepsPersistingThem` (:289). **Deliberate contract change:** the old "adoption itself writes nothing" assertion became "adopted snapshots are pending and are then written". |
| A F03-R1 | **Fixed.** The ordinary-outcome tail-missing obligation is a small additive optional field on the transcript turn (`recoveredOutcome`: run attempt ID and observation time), set by cold restore only when the turn's joined attempt has an ordinary terminal outcome. It is not an interruption, and closed ordinary turns are not marked. It persists through save and reload and through rebuilds (`preservingInterruptedTurnEnvelopes`). Reconciliation lists outcome turns from the marker plus the record's terminal attempt, on every later launch, until Dismiss. The launch-only `coldRestoreOrdinaryOutcomeTurnIDs` map and its `noteColdRestoreStamps` parameter are removed. | `AgentMode/Models/AgentTranscriptModels.swift` (`AgentTranscriptTurnRecoveredOutcome` :519, `AgentTranscriptTurn.recoveredOutcome`); `Transcript/AgentTranscriptServices.swift` :2811–2832; `AgentSessionRestoreSupport.swift` (`recoveredOutcome(for:)` :393, `sanitizeColdRestoredTurn`); `AgentSessionDataService.swift` :3708; test `AgentRecoveryStartupReconciliationTests.testOrdinaryOutcomeTailWarningSurvivesFreshLaunchesUntilDismissed` (:1467). It covers three launches, durable Dismiss, an unrelated record write, and the closed turn staying unmarked. |
| A P2 (F05 residual: closed-session Open identity) | **Fixed.** The coordinator keeps each session's latest lane-claim compose tab next to its workspace (`laneComposeTabIDs`, from the owning `AgentTabSession`). Unlisted-session rows (runs, intents, questions, durable drafts) carry it, so Open is offered. A tab that now hosts another session is still refused by the existing `sessionTabMismatch` route check. | `Recovery/AgentRecoveryCoordinator.swift` :1117, `knownComposeTabID(for:)` :1139; `Recovery/AgentRecoveryCatalog.swift` :623; test `AgentRecoveryCoordinatorTests.testClosedSessionOfThisLaunchKeepsItsComposeTabForOpen` (:1643). |
| A P2 (F08 residual: legacy index entry without an attempt) | **Fixed by requiring Open before Dismiss** (no migration or compatibility shim). An index-read summary without an attempt has `requiresOpenBeforeDismiss`, so the catalog gives it no acknowledgement card, Dismiss is refused, and Open stays available. An entry naming its attempt stays dismissable. This is conservative: a current entry for a schedule with no attempt is indistinguishable from a legacy one and is treated the same way. | `Scheduling/AgentScheduledSendCoordinator.swift` (`AgentScheduledSendConfirmationSummary.requiresOpenBeforeDismiss`); `Recovery/AgentRecoveryCoordinator.swift` :643; `Recovery/AgentRecoveryCatalog.swift` :773; test `AgentRecoveryCoordinatorTests.testIndexedScheduleWithoutAttemptRequiresOpenBeforeDismiss` (:1939). |

### Lane B

| Finding | Disposition | Anchors |
|---|---|---|
| B R1-F3 | **Fixed** together with A F01-R1 (same change and tests). | as A F01-R1 |
| B R1-F1 | **Verified, then fixed narrowly.** Real steering opens its own turn: `importLegacyItems` starts a new turn for every `.user` item and never appends one as an activity. So a mid-turn user activity can come only from saved data. Two fixes cover that shape: the live-teardown stamp finds the turn *containing* the user item (`containsUserItem`: turn ID, request anchor, or mid-turn user activity), and the run/turn join resolves a single distinct steered attempt from mid-turn user activities. More than one distinct attempt is ambiguous and is not joined. | `AgentSessionRestoreSupport.swift` :6–11 (`containsUserItem`, `userActivityIDs`), :86–87 (join); `AgentRunTerminalCommitBarrier.swift` :488; test `AgentRecoveryStartupReconciliationTests.testLiveTeardownStampSurvivesSaveAndReloadAndReconcilesByRunAttempt` (:377), now over `none`, `ownTurn` and `midTurnActivity`, through a real save, teardown, reload and reconcile. |
| B R1-F7 (cheap P3) | **Fixed.** When a provisional unknown stamp is withdrawn for a known ordinary outcome, spans closed as provisionally cancelled are re-closed with the outcome's lifecycle. | `AgentSessionRestoreSupport.swift` :591 |
| B R1-F6 (P3: failed or withdrawn steers in `latestTurnID`) | **Deferred.** It is cosmetic row placement only and no evidence requires it now. | — |
| B other P3 (noise, retention, performance, test-environment polish) | **Deferred** per main. | — |

### Main's R1 cheap P2 items (item 4)

| Item | Disposition | Anchors |
|---|---|---|
| Same-owner, lane-only hand-over during native question creation | **Fixed (fails loudly).** The run fence and the lane fence are separate. If the run changed, the request is dropped, which preserves the replacement-run fence: the replacement turn is not interrupted. If only the lane was handed over and the same run still waits with no lifecycle teardown, the result is `persistenceFailed`: the run fails with the generic message and the provider turn is interrupted (R1: `interruptUserTurn(expectedTurnID:)`, else `reconcileAndInterruptCurrentTurn()`; **superseded post-cap by F11-R2**: exact pinned turn only, no unscoped fallback). It is never answered. Window close or quit keeps its own teardown cause. | `Codex/CodexAgentModeCoordinator.swift` `admitCodexNativeQuestion` (:7114 `laneHeld`, :7152), `failCodexRunForUnsavedQuestion` (:7172–7190); tests `CodexAgentModeCoordinatorLivenessTests.testNativeQuestionLaneHandOverDuringCreationFailsTheRunLoudlyAndInterruptsTheProvider` (:1264, new, both kinds). An interrupt is also asserted in the creation-failure test, and *no* interrupt in the replacement-run test. |
| Headless typed process-loss pass-through | **Fixed** for the ACP bridge's outer catch (`outerStreamError`): provider normalization (e.g. Cursor's) could rewrap the typed error. Claude's outer `mapError` already returns non-runner errors unchanged, so no change was needed there. | `AI/Providers/ACPHeadlessAgentProviderBridge.swift` :163; test `AgentRunTerminalCauseTests.testHeadlessBridgePassesTypedProcessLossThroughProviderNormalization` (:366). |
| Real Claude controller lookup through the protocol existential | **Tested.** The first lookup goes through `any NativeAgentRuntimeControlling`, before the direct call, because the answer is consumed once. | `AgentRunTerminalCauseTests.testClaudeControllerAttributesOnlyUnexpectedEOFTurnsToProcessLoss` (:308) |

### R1-fix limitations

- A lane-only hand-over whose creation write succeeded leaves the snapshot committed in the retired controller. It then appears as a historical "Expired question", not a live one.
- "Actual reconciliation" for the tail-missing obligation is listing: the item is listed while the record keeps the attempt's terminal evidence, until Dismiss. Nothing clears the marker automatically.
- Provisional withdrawal does not reset `summary.hadError`.
- The mid-turn variant calls `stampLiveInterruption` with the user item ID directly, not the whole live barrier. The B F9 coordinator path is still not constructible through test seams.

## Review-fix dispositions (initial-review fixes; superseded where R1 found residuals)

All fixes keep the R4 architecture and the question-timing assumption. Anchors are symbols; paths are under `Sources/RepoPromptAgentCore/AgentMode/Runtime/` unless stated.

| Finding | Disposition | Anchors |
|---|---|---|
| A F01 | **Fixed.** A reply is sent only after the answer's snapshot is durably preserved within the bound; a timeout or failure sends nothing, keeps the answer and pending request, re-arms the `ask_user` timeout, and lists a "Answer not sent" save-failure item. | `Recovery/AgentRecoveryQuestionPersistenceController.swift` (`preserveBeforeReply`, `replyPreservation`, `needsPreservation`, `unsentAnswerIDs`); `AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryQuestions.swift` (`resolveAfterRecoveryQuestionFlush`, `notSent:`); tests `AgentRecoveryResetBoundaryTests.testDelayedPreservationSendsNoReplyAndKeepsTheAnswerForRetry`, `testFailedPreservationSendsNoReplyKeepsTheAnswerAndRearmsTheTimeout` (replace the old early-reply test: deliberate contract change). |
| A F02 / B F11 | **Fixed.** Codex `requestUserInput` and `mcpElicitationRequest` commit before publish; after the await, lane, controller, run state, ownership, generation, run ID and controller instance are revalidated; a failed creation fails the run with a generic message and shows/replies nothing. | `Codex/CodexAgentModeCoordinator.swift` (`admitCodexNativeQuestion`, `CodexNativeQuestionAdmission`, `failCodexRunForUnsavedQuestion`); tests `CodexAgentModeCoordinatorLivenessTests.testNativeQuestionIsCommittedBeforeItIsShownOrQueued`, `testNativeQuestionCreationWriteFailureFailsRunWithoutShowingOrReplying`, `testNativeQuestionSuspendedAcrossRunReplacementIsNotShownAndItsSnapshotEnds` (each over both request kinds). |
| A F03 / B F7 | **Fixed.** Cold restore closes a turn whose joined attempt has ordinary terminal evidence as that outcome, with no new crash interruption (a provisional unknown stamp is cleared); such turns are listed as outcome turns. | `AgentSessionRestoreSupport.swift` (`ordinaryTerminalOutcome(for:)`, `interruption(for:)`, `sanitizeColdRestoredTurn`); `Recovery/AgentRecoveryStartupReconciliation.swift` (`AgentRecoveryOutcomeTurn`, `outcomeTurns`); `AgentSessionDataService.swift` (`coldRestoreOrdinaryOutcomeTurnIDs`); test `AgentRecoveryStartupReconciliationTests.testColdHydrationClosesOrdinaryTerminalOutcomesWithoutInterruptionThroughSaveAndReload`; `testColdRestoreStampsOpenTurnsBeforeNormalizationAndRestoresAcceptedBubblesOnce` updated (deliberate contract change: the completed turn is an outcome turn, not interrupted). |
| A F04 / B F6 | **Fixed.** The catalog projects this launch's run attempts whose terminal cause has an interruption reason, on their (steered) turn or as a recovery-only run, including sessions without a live lane. | `Recovery/AgentRecoveryCatalog.swift` (`addLiveRunInterruptions`, `addHeldInputOfUnlistedSessions`); `Recovery/AgentRecoveryCoordinator.swift` (`knownWorkspaceID(for:)`); test `AgentRecoveryCoordinatorTests.testCatalogListsLiveRunInterruptionsAfterStartupOnTheSteeredTurn`. |
| A F05 | **Fixed.** Durable drafts of sessions without a live lane are listed (`.closedSessionDraft`), with Open and Dismiss. | `AgentRecoveryCatalog.swift` (`addDurableComposer`); `AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryList.swift` (`.closedSessionDraft` row); test `AgentRecoveryCoordinatorTests.testCatalogListsDurableDraftsOfSessionsWithoutALiveLane`. |
| A F06 / B F10 | **Fixed** for Claude, ACP and headless; Codex mapping tested. Claude: the controller records turns failed by an unexpected stdout EOF and the runner asks `turnEndedByProcessLoss`; a stream end with the attempt still active is process loss. ACP: `providerProcessWasLost` after an unexpected process exit. Headless: typed `HeadlessProviderProcessLostError`. | `Native/NativeAgentRuntimeContracts.swift` (`turnEndedByProcessLoss`); `AI/Providers/ClaudeCode/SDK/ClaudeNativeProcessSessionController.swift` (`turnEndedByProcessLoss` — must be `async`, see failures below; `processLostTurnIDs`); `Runners/ClaudeIntegratedAgentModeRunner.swift` (`ConsumeEventsOutcome.cause`, `failedTurnID`); `AI/ACP/ACPAgentSessionController.swift` (`providerProcessWasLost`); `Runners/ACPIntegratedAgentModeRunner.swift` (`terminalCause(terminalState:controller:)`); `AgentMode/Providers/HeadlessAgentProvider.swift`, `AI/Providers/ACPHeadlessAgentProviderBridge.swift`, `ClaudeCodeAgentProvider.swift`, `Runners/HeadlessAgentModeRunner.swift`; tests `AgentRunTerminalCauseTests.testClaudeControllerAttributesOnlyUnexpectedEOFTurnsToProcessLoss`, `testACPProcessExitUnderAPromptIsProcessLossAndAnErrorResponseIsOrdinary`, `testCodexFinalizeReasonsMapOnlyTransportLossToProcessLoss`; Claude runner fake tests in `ClaudeNativeBackgroundTranscriptTests.swift` (an `AgentModeRunServiceLifecycleTests` extension: process exit → `.providerProcessLost`, `testClaudeProviderReportedFailureStaysOrdinary`). |
| A F07 | **Fixed.** Acknowledgement eviction removed; only other incarnations' acknowledgements are dropped. | `Recovery/AgentRecoveryStore.swift`; test `AgentRecoveryStoreTests.testCardAcknowledgementRefusesChangedCardsOtherIncarnationsAndNeverEvictsAnother` (129 acknowledgements; deliberate contract change from the eviction test). |
| A F08 | **Fixed.** Index schedule summaries carry the recorded attempt, so an index card keeps its freshness when the session hydrates. Residual: entries written before this change decode with no attempt until rewritten. | `AgentSessionMetadataIndex.swift` (`AgentSessionScheduledSendSummary.attemptID`); `AgentRecoveryCoordinator.readIndexedSchedules`; tests `AgentSessionMetadataRecordExtensionTests.testScheduledSummaryCarriesTheAttemptAndAnEntryWithoutItDecodes`, `AgentRecoveryCoordinatorTests.testIndexedScheduleCardKeepsItsOccurrenceFreshnessAcrossHydration`. |
| A F09 | **Fixed.** Wording states only what the evidence establishes: "Completed; transcript tail may be missing", "Run cancelled", "The run was cancelled". | `AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryList.swift` (`recoveryListTurnText(status:reason:)`, `recoveryListOutcomeTurnText`); test `AgentRecoveryStartupCompositionTests.testRecoveredRunWordingStatesOnlyWhatTheEvidenceEstablishes`. |
| A F10 | **Fixed.** The banner stays when only elsewhere items exist. | `Sources/RepoPrompt/.../UI/AgentComposerUIModels.swift` (`AgentRecoveryListProps.isEmpty`); covered in `testRecoveryListRowsResolveSessionsFromTheCatalogAndOpenAcrossWorkspaces`. |
| B F1 | **Fixed.** The run/turn join also maps steered intent attempts to their run attempt, so a live teardown stamp on a steering turn reconciles by run attempt; end-to-end teardown → save → reload → reconcile test. | `AgentSessionRestoreSupport.swift` (`AgentRecoveryRunTurnJoin` `steeredAttemptsByTurnID`, `latestTurnID(of:)`); test `AgentRecoveryStartupReconciliationTests.testLiveTeardownStampSurvivesSaveAndReloadAndReconcilesByRunAttempt` (plain and steered), `AgentRunTerminalCauseTests.testColdRestoreJoinsASteeredTurnToItsRunAttempt`. |
| B F2 | **Fixed.** Historical questions are titled "Expired question" with "Whether an answer reached the agent is uncertain…", actions Open and Dismiss. | `AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryList.swift`; covered in `testRecoveryListRowsResolveSessionsFromTheCatalogAndOpenAcrossWorkspaces`. |
| B F3 | **Fixed.** Question save failures and unsent answers are a `.saveFailure` catalog item (`savefail-question-<id>`) with Retry in the owning window; failed writes retry automatically at most `automaticRetryLimit` (3) times, then only on demand. | `AgentRecoveryCatalog.swift` (`.questionSaveFailed`, `questionSaveFailureItemID`); controller `writePending` retry; `AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryList.swift` (`retryRecoveryListSave`); test `AgentRecoveryQuestionPersistenceTests.testFailedWritesRetryAutomaticallyAtMostTheBoundThenOnlyOnDemand`, plus F01/F02 tests. |
| B F4 | **Fixed.** A schema-7 index (same schedule-summary shape) is read for schedule discovery only, uncached and never rewritten; older schemas still give "couldn't be checked". | `AgentSessionDataService.swift` (`readScheduleCompatibleOlderMetadataIndex`, `oldestScheduleCompatibleMetadataIndexSchemaVersion`); test `AgentRecoveryCoordinatorTests.testScheduleCompatibleOlderIndexIsReadForScheduleDiscoveryWithoutRewriting`. |
| B F5 / cross-workspace Open | **Fixed.** Rows resolve their session from the catalog (`paused-` maps to `crash-`); Open on another workspace's item routes through the deep-link router. | `AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryList.swift` (`recoveryListCatalogItem`, `recoveryListSessionID`, `openRecoveryListSession`, `RecoveryListSessionRouter`); test `testRecoveryListRowsResolveSessionsFromTheCatalogAndOpenAcrossWorkspaces` (paused confirm lifts the block and writes the acknowledgement; run and schedule rows route exactly; a failed route reports failure). |
| B F8 | **Verified, no source change.** Withdrawing the last intent keeps the record and its acknowledgements. | test `AgentRecoveryStoreTests.testWithdrawingTheLastIntentKeepsCardAcknowledgements`. |
| B F9 | **Fixed** for same-owner, same-binding hand-over: the successor adopts the predecessor's still-live snapshots. | `AgentRecoveryCoordinator.claimLane` (`preservesOwnership`); controller `adoptLiveInteractions`; test `AgentRecoveryQuestionPersistenceTests.testSuccessorAdoptsOnlyStillLiveInteractionsAndKeepsPersistingThem`. Limit below. |
| B F11 producer inventory | `ask_user`: `AgentModeViewModel` via `commitAskUserForRecovery` (delegated routing mutates the same interaction). Codex user input and elicitation: `admitCodexNativeQuestion`. `RemoteAgentModeCoordinator` mirrors are host-owned (`lane(for:)` is nil with a remote host). `ContextBuilderAgentViewModel` `ask_user` has no recovery lanes. Claude, ACP and OMP produce approvals only, no questions. | — |
| F12 | **Fixed (message).** The `ask_user` creation error is generic. The asymmetry is intended: `ask_user` refuses the unsaved question; Codex native fails the run (it can't be refused). | `AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryQuestions.swift`. |
| F13 | **Fixed.** Neutral "Run cancelled" wording. | `AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryList.swift`. |
| F14 | **Deferred.** Equality of `AgentMCPElicitationRequest` including `askedAt` matches the baseline remote rebuild behavior; not changed in this phase. | `UserInteractionModels.swift`. |
| F15 | **Partly fixed.** Failed writes now retry (B F3). **Deferred:** bounding the Codex creation write needs a policy decision on what a timed-out creation does. | controller `writePending`. |
| F16 | **Fixed.** Removed the unused `otherItemCount(...)` and the unread `.restricted` blocker. | `AgentRecoveryCatalog.swift`. |
| F17 | **Deferred, no signal.** Codex `serverRequest/resolved` carries no request ID, so no request-scoped cancel signal exists; turn end and run replacement are covered by the ownership fence. | `admitCodexNativeQuestion`. |
| F18 | **Deferred (advisory).** Coalescing hint rewrites per folder is a performance item. | — |
| F19 | **Fixed.** Dismiss failures use user wording ("This item couldn't be dismissed. It is still listed; try again."); other-workspace Open now works (above) instead of being hidden. | `AgentRecoveryCoordinator.dismissCatalogItem`. |

Preserved failed runs in this pass, all fixed without weakening an assertion:
- `91895422` (CodexAgentModeCoordinatorLivenessTests, 2 failures): a new test wrongly expected `.running`; the producer sets a waiting state. The assertion is now `runState.isActive`.
- `341d064b` (AgentRecoveryStartupReconciliationTests, 1 failure): the R4 test expected a completed open turn as interrupted; changed deliberately for F03.
- `9206c550` and `cdb70980` (AgentRunTerminalCauseTests, Claude EOF test): a real production bug. A synchronous actor `turnEndedByProcessLoss` does not witness or shadow the protocol extension's `async` default, so both the conformance and direct `await` calls returned `false`. The controller method is now `async`; the test's assertions are unchanged.

Other contract changes: F01 test replacement, F03 outcome turns, F07 no-eviction test, F16 removal.

Review-fix limits:
- B F9 coordinator path (same owner and binding, different persistence state) cannot be constructed through the existing test seams; it is covered at the controller boundary. An owner change still makes earlier questions historical (the question-timing assumption); a design decision for main.
- The headless runner is unreachable for current Agent Mode kinds, so its typed mapping is untested at the runner boundary.
- The Claude stream-end-without-terminal branch cannot be driven by the fake (it re-subscribes to an empty stream).
- Codex provider loss is tested through the static reason mapping only.

## Manifest

Cut 2, typed terminal causes and honest reconciliation:
- Core: `AgentRecoveryModels.swift` (`AgentRunTerminalCause`), `AgentRunTerminalCommitBarrier.swift`, `AgentModeRunService.swift`, `AgentSessionRestoreSupport.swift`, `AgentRecoveryStartupReconciliation.swift`, `Codex/CodexAgentModeCoordinator.swift`, `Runners/{ACP,Claude}IntegratedAgentModeRunner.swift`, `Runners/HeadlessAgentModeRunner.swift`, `Session/AgentTabSession.swift`.
- App callers: `AgentModeViewModel+Shutdown.swift`, `AgentModeViewModel+StaleResetRecovery.swift`, `WorkspaceSwitchSessionProviders.swift`, `MCP/Agent/AgentManageMCPToolService.swift`, `MCP/Agent/AgentRunMCPToolService.swift`, `MCP/AgentMCPComposition.swift`.
- Tests: new `AgentRunTerminalCauseTests.swift`; caller updates in `AgentModeRunServiceLifecycleTests`, `AgentModeStopSubmitTargetTests`, `AgentModeMCPWaitEpochTests`, `AttentionNotificationAdmissionTests`, `ClaudeAgentModeCoordinatorLifecycleTests`, `AgentProviderHandoffTests`, `AgentRunWorktreeStartTests`, and `AgentRecoveryTestSupport`.

Cut 3, question persistence in normal operation:
- Files: new `Recovery/AgentRecoveryQuestionPersistenceController.swift`, new `Recovery/AgentRecoveryLiveQuestions.swift`, `AgentRecoveryQuestionSnapshotBuilder.swift`, `UserInteractionModels.swift`, new `AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryQuestions.swift`, `AgentModeViewModel.swift`, `AgentModeView.swift`.
- Tests: new `AgentRecoveryQuestionPersistenceTests.swift`; `AgentRecoveryResetBoundaryTests`.

Cut 4, schema-8 hints and durable acknowledgement:
- Files: `AgentSessionMetadataIndex.swift` (`AgentSessionRecoveryHint`, `RecordFacts`), `AgentSessionDataService.swift` (`adoptRecoveryHintInventory`, `noteRecoveryRecordCommitted(sessionID:sequence:facts:)`, `performClosedRecoveryTransaction`), `AgentRecoveryModels.swift` (`AgentRecoveryCardKey`, `AgentRecoveryCardFreshness`, acknowledgements), `AgentRecoveryRecordCodec.swift`, `AgentRecoveryStore.swift`.
- Tests: `AgentSessionMetadataRecordExtensionTests` (schema 7→8 plus hint tests), `AgentRecoveryStoreTests` (acknowledgement tests), and `AgentScheduledSendPersistenceTests` (schema assertion 7→8).

Cut 5, coordinator catalog and UI:
- Core: new `Recovery/AgentRecoveryCatalog.swift`, `AgentRecoveryCoordinator.swift` (cached catalog, `.agentRecoveryCatalogDidChange`, `attachScheduler`, `dismissCatalogItem`, shared action states), and `Scheduling/AgentScheduledSendCoordinator.swift`.
- App: `AgentRecoveryAppComposition.swift`, `AgentModeViewModel+Recovery.swift`, `AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryList.swift` (rewritten onto the catalog), `UI/AgentComposerUIModels.swift`, `AgentInputBar.swift`, `AgentRecoveryListBanner.swift`, new `AgentRecoveryNeedsAttentionSheet.swift`, and `AgentSessionsSidebarView.swift`.
- Tests: `AgentRecoveryCoordinatorTests` (catalog tests), `AgentRecoveryStartupCompositionTests`, `AgentRecoveryVMProducerAdmissionTests`, and `AgentRecoveryResetBoundaryTests` (deliberate action-contract updates).

Contract-gap completion (main's pre-review gaps; the R4 architecture and the question-timing assumption are unchanged):
- App-wide entry point: new `App/AgentRecoveryNeedsAttentionCommands.swift` (the View-menu command "Needs Attention…" and `AgentRecoveryNeedsAttentionRouter`), `RepoPromptApp.swift` (registers it), `WindowContentView.swift` (the root `AgentRecoveryNeedsAttentionHost` modifier), and `AgentRecoveryNeedsAttentionSheet.swift` (the host). `AgentModeViewModel.swift` and `AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryList.swift` add the pending request: `presentRecoveryNeedsAttention` and `consumeRecoveryNeedsAttentionRequest`. `AgentSessionsSidebarView.swift` keeps its button, which now uses the same request.
- Closed-session and closed-workspace schedules:
  - `AgentSessionDataService.recoveryIndexedSessionRecords(for:)` reads the index only and creates nothing.
  - `AgentRecoveryCoordinator`: `attachScheduler(_:hydratedSessionIDs:indexWorkspaces:)`, `mergedScheduleConfirmations`, and a coalesced `requestIndexedScheduleRefresh`.
  - `AgentRecoveryCatalog.swift`: `AgentRecoveryIndexedSchedules`, `.scheduleIndexUnavailable`, and identity-level merging; the session-level `transferSessionIDs` suppression is removed.
  - `AgentScheduledSendConfirmationSummary`: `tabID` is now optional and `sessionName` is added.
  - The scheduler's dashboard signature now includes transfer holds. This is notification-only; admission and dispatch policy are unchanged.
  - `AgentRecoveryAppComposition.swift` wires the hydrated sessions and the inventory.
- Preparation failures: they are now a coordinator catalog item (`draft-prep-<tab>`, kind `.saveFailure`, payload `.composerPreparationFailed`, with no acknowledgement), built from `failedComposerPreparations`. The view model's separate preparation row is removed. The banner's tab-aware filter is `bannerItems(sessionID:workspaceID:tabID:)`.
- Tests:
  - `AgentRecoveryCoordinatorTests.testCatalogListsIndexedScheduleConfirmationsOfUnhostedSessionsByScheduleIdentity`.
  - `AgentRecoveryStartupCompositionTests.testNeedsAttentionRouteReachesAnyWindowWithoutHydratingAndStaysReachableWhenAllDismissed`.
  - `AgentRecoveryStartupCompositionTests.testFailedComposerPreparationAndActionResultArePublishedToEveryWindow`.

Not mine and left untouched: `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, `Scripts/source_layout_guardrails.sh`, `CodemapSeamTestSupport.swift`, the code-mode docs, the lossless-restart spec, `phase2-plan.md`, the turn-worktree-checkpoints spec, and the completed codemap-wait plan.

## Implementation assumptions (owner-reversible)

- **Question timing:** follows main's explicit assumption in `phase2-plan.md`. A question is "live" while the lane's `questionPersistence.liveInteractionIDs` contains it. Liveness is lane-keyed, so a lane replacement (reset or owner change) turns an earlier question into a historical catalog item.
- **Banner contract (changed tests):**
  - The composer banner shows only the active session's catalog items, excluding schedules, which stay with the scheduled-send banner.
  - Items from other sessions moved to the Needs Attention sheet, and the banner shows a "Needs Attention (n)…" affordance.
  - Hide is replaced by a durable Dismiss on intents, drafts, questions, runs, and crash holds. Questions offer "Remove saved question", mapped to the existing discard.
- **Crash holds:** a dismissed crash-hold card keeps the banner's paused indicator, so Dismiss never hides an active block.
- **Preparation failures:** these are a runtime-only catalog item from the coordinator's live preparation obligations, not durable record state.
  - Nothing new is persisted, and there is no durable Dismiss: Dismiss returns "This item can't be dismissed."
  - Only the window that owns the tab offers Retry. Other windows list the item without actions.
  - The item clears only when a retry, hand-off, or discard clears the obligation.
- **Schedule items:** one item per schedule identity.
  - The scheduler's summaries come first, for sessions that a window hosts or hydrated.
  - Then come the metadata-index summaries of every inventory workspace, for sessions that neither the scheduler nor a hydrated window covers. This includes closed workspaces, and closed sessions in open workspaces.
  - A schedule whose exact attempt is held for transfer is left out; a different schedule of the same session is not.
  - The index read is coalesced and never rebuilds, creates, registers, hydrates, or confirms anything.
  - A workspace that has session files but no current index gets a `schedule-index-<workspace>` "couldn't be checked" item.
  - The read is triggered by startup ready, by scheduler dashboard changes, by `attachScheduler`, and by each Needs Attention request. If the inventory can't be read, the last read is kept.
- **Needs Attention entry point:**
  - Every window has a root sheet host, and the View-menu command "Needs Attention…" is always enabled, even when the count is 0, so "Show dismissed" stays reachable.
  - The command routes to the focused window, else the latest one. With no window, it opens one through the existing `openNewMainWindow` route and then presents there.
  - The banner affordance and the sidebar button post the same per-view-model request. A request stays pending until the window's host consumes it, so the route works with every tab or the sidebar closed.
  - Presenting starts, hydrates, and resumes nothing.
- **Closed-session Dismiss (authority boundary, not an owner decision):**
  - Dismiss writes only through a live lane or a startup resolution that has a binding and a workspace.
  - A closed or unknown session without that editable authority returns "Open this session to dismiss this item." This includes index-only schedule items and items from other workspaces.
  - Writes are revalidated against the current projection and in-store (`recordStillMatches`), and revision conflicts are retried 3 times.
- **Accepted plan behavior (not open questions):** the banner is an exact session and tab filter, and Dismiss releases no safety hold, so a dismissed crash hold keeps its paused indicator.
- **Freshness tokens:**
  - Runs use status|reason.
  - Intents use delivery state, held, and stale.
  - Questions and held drafts use a constant token, so a new entity gets a new key.
  - Schedules use attempt, reason, and notBefore.
  - Crash holds use the sorted ID sets.

## Process deviations (reported honestly)

- **Shell reads:** about 16 distinct shell commands (`grep`, `sed -n`, `wc -l`) read Sources and Tests text before the workflow correction. They had no side effects.
- **Edits:**
  - A transcript audit of session `933b06f7…jsonl` found 238 `apply_edits` calls across 55 paths.
  - The audit found no shell, Python, `sed -i`, redirect, native `Write`/`Edit`, or `file_actions` content edits.
  - This resolves the earlier uncertainty: cut-2 edits also used `apply_edits`.
- **Superseded evidence:**
  - Before the validation correction, several runs used `make dev-test-artifact` and found logs via `ls -t` over global job logs.
  - Those results are **artifact-only** and superseded. They include an earlier coordinator `invalidPersistenceStamp` failure and two metadata-suite failures, all fixed before the accepted runs.
  - One combined-filter `make dev-test` and the first post-fix `AgentRecoveryStoreTests` `dev-test` run had their tickets taken from `ls -t`, so they are not counted as accepted evidence.

- **Review-fix pass deviations:**
  - Some Sources text was again read with shell `grep`/`sed`/`awk`/`git show` (including `ClaudeNativeProcessSessionController.swift`) before main's renewed correction. These reads had no side effects.
  - While bisecting a SwiftFormat lint misparse, I ran `swiftformat` and a Python hunk-split script on **copies** under `/tmp`. Repository files were edited only with `apply_edits`.
  - Earlier compaction summaries were read from the session transcript log with Python.
  - No file, cache or other deletion or cleanup command was issued. Nothing was staged or committed.

- **R1-fix pass deviations:**
  - I made one `mcp__RepoPromptCE__agent_explore` `op:"start"` call (tool_use `toolu_01VuX7viT3Tzc7pk7uY477wn`, 2026-10-21T15:34:49Z). It asked a read-only question about how steering lands in the transcript. Starting agents is forbidden. The server **rejected** it (`is_error`: "only available to MCP-started non-explore Agent Mode runs"), so no child was created and there is no child ID. No other agent_run, agent_manage or agent_explore call was made, and the steering question was answered by reading source.
  - One edit call used a wrong tool name (`apply_edits` without the MCP prefix). It failed with "No such tool" and had no effect.
  - Shell was used only for conductor, test logs, the session transcript log and Git.
  - Failed runs are preserved, not deleted. No file, cache or other deletion or cleanup command was issued. Nothing was staged or committed.

## Validation (accepted: coordinated `make dev-test FILTER=<Suite>`, tickets from each command's own output)

### R1-fix validation

- **Compile:** `make dev-swift-build PRODUCT=RepoPrompt` ticket `6078924d-d6e8-42b5-adc0-8d6f1a9c5bb5`. After the lint fixes it was rerun as ticket `0df10317-bb70-411e-a785-fd3d8143858d`; both builds completed.
- **Lint:**
  - `make dev-lint` ticket `b109fbe4-b069-4c5a-97f6-9592bda6ccc7` **failed** (preserved). The failures were `extensionAccessControl` on the new `AgentTranscriptTurn` extension and `noForceUnwrapInTests` in the new hand-over test.
  - After fixing both (modifier placement; `XCTUnwrap`), ticket `6dee5ec8-aaa0-4e4b-a83a-87c13626f3ab` passed.
- **Failed runs (preserved):**
  - `AgentRunTerminalCauseTests` ticket `0625a174-2cbe-48fe-af81-d91e21c74b0a` was a test compile error: an actor `await` inside `XCTUnwrap`'s autoclosure in a new coordinator test.
  - `AgentRecoveryCoordinatorTests` ticket `ee97d3f5-cff7-4b0f-b2ff-ff96fbad26e7` had 1 failure: the new indexed-schedule test's non-vacuity check found that a closed session has no incarnation in that fixture. The fixture now claims lanes and does not hydrate, and the assertions are unchanged.

Before the lint fixes, the last three suites also passed: tickets `6f5114e8-…` (14), `a0e4cdcc-…` (19) and `a03e88ed-…` (15).

No source edit followed the final validation.

Scoped `git diff --check` over the changed paths passed. `Scripts/check-agent-context` reports two header errors in main's untracked raw R1 review files (`phase2-oraclea-r1.md`, `phase2-oracleb-r1.md`). Those are main-owned and untouched here. It also reports the existing AGENTS.md route-count warning.

The initial-fix suites that R1 did not touch (`AgentSessionMetadataRecordExtensionTests` and others in the table below) were not rerun.

### Initial review-fix validation

Compile: `make dev-swift-build PRODUCT=RepoPrompt` after the final lint fixes, ticket `15bbb811-11e5-4220-98af-aad85b809fa3`, build complete.

Lint:
- `make dev-lint` ticket `3bc734da-7e82-47fa-a0a1-5f243b5c1960` **failed**. Failures:
  - indentation in `AgentInputBar` and the sheet;
  - `redundantSendable` on the new package types and on `AgentRunTerminalCause`;
  - `preferCountWhere`, `redundantSelf`, and `hoistTry`.
- These were fixed by hand with no `make dev-format`.
- The rerun, ticket `37546c24-1e62-4be9-9074-435c4547df0e`, completed successfully: 0/2134 files need formatting and swiftlint is clean.

Suites run after the final source edits:

Two filters in that batch were rejected by conductor with exit 64 and ran nothing:
- `ClaudeAgentModeCoordinatorLifecycleTests` is an extension file, not a suite, and is covered above.
- `AgentModeShutdownTests` does not exist; an earlier artifact loop also used that wrong guess.

Contract-gap completion, run after the final source and fixture edits:

- Compile: `make dev-swift-build PRODUCT=RepoPrompt`.
  - The gap source edits built with ticket `68bfe40a-d574-479c-a3cf-35cd27b74389`.
  - After the scheduler dashboard-signature edit, ticket `6d4ecc11-1d6a-4853-95bb-441ae1d3a0cd` succeeded. Its only warnings come from unmodified files: `AgentScheduledSend.swift:142` and `AgentProviderHandoff.swift:338`.
- Lint: `make dev-lint` ticket `7f35359a-012c-4173-a04f-8af17a89bd8f` **failed** on indentation in `openRecoveryListSession`. This was fixed by hand, and ticket `ac518c16-e8f8-418b-bde1-36fb0e223508` passed.

Review-fix pass (after every review fix and the final lint edits; supersedes the tables above for the final tree):

- Intermediate accepted runs: builds `11ad7cbe`, `ea76ec49`, `e60d2c9e`, `5da24a7b`, `c3c94455`, `2e8af5ff`, `7f8e661f`, `8170ad34`, `04ec7df1`, `5be9fe42`, `bf2a8acf`. Preserved failures `91895422`, `341d064b`, `9206c550`, `cdb70980` are explained in the dispositions above.
- Lint: `make dev-lint` ticket `aad0ac0a` **failed**. Findings:
  - SwiftFormat misparsed the file after an inline `@MainActor` closure default on `recoveryListRouteToSession`. Fixed with the `RecoveryListSessionRouter` typealias and a static router.
  - `hoistAwait`/`hoistTry` and blank-line/doc-comment findings in the RecoveryList VM, catalog, coordinator, question controller, ACP runner and reconciliation tests.
  - All were fixed by hand; no `make dev-format`. Rerun `b676d937-118b-40d3-a584-5a43b06836ab` passed: 0/2135 files need formatting and swiftlint is clean.
- Compile after the lint edits: `make dev-swift-build PRODUCT=RepoPrompt` ticket `2165a5f0-3b56-429f-ab6f-68f89c0b0343`, succeeded.

`ClaudeNativeBackgroundTranscriptTests` is not a conductor filter (exit 64). Its tests run inside `AgentModeRunServiceLifecycleTests`.

## Signing retry authorization

On 2026-10-22 the owner authorized another normal signed commit attempt and explicitly allowed unsigned local commits if signing remains unavailable. The staged tree before this documentation update matched the previously checked snapshot `a0e12440a72c4358109c49f3d411ade03677490b`; HEAD was still `57e451205ecded20a42b3ce1b61834ebd514cbac`. No source changed during recovery. The authorization is recorded as O8 in the plan and supersedes O6's unsigned-fallback prohibition. The implementation and final bounded fixes remain validated as recorded below.

## Signing checkpoint

The normal signed commit `Preserve recovery questions and report interrupted runs honestly` failed with exit 128: `1Password: failed to fill whole buffer` / `failed to write commit object`. No unsigned bypass, signing configuration change or history rewrite was attempted. The intended 80 paths remain staged; unrelated original changes are excluded. Main asked the owner whether to retry once while available or leave the snapshot staged. The question timed out after 181 seconds without an answer, so main stopped without another signing attempt. All workers and conductor jobs were finished. HEAD remains `57e451205ecded20a42b3ce1b61834ebd514cbac` until a successful retry is explicitly recorded.

## Final checkpoint assessment

Final source/test tree: `38c02a872d9d6caef5b21cc7758570b3e1ab0ccd`. The read-only checkpoint scope audit inspected the complete baseline-to-R2 diff (69 paths, 49 source and 20 tests; no deletions, frozen ledger unchanged) and found no concrete scope, accidental-debug or test-weakening issue. Main read the complete R2-to-final delta (two source files, the Codex liveness tests and their shared fixture; 70 total source/test paths) and the real controller's turn-scoped interruption guard. Main accepts F11-R2 and R2-F1 as fixed on that evidence and the focused tests, not on another Oracle approval. Both initial reviews and the two ordinary re-reviews are complete; this final bounded delta was not re-reviewed.

Main independently confirmed all six post-cap source-validating suites (167 tests total) and lint completed with exit 0. No separate compile was needed after those test builds. The conductor running-job list and real index were empty before staging. Unrelated original changes remain excluded. The owner question about exceeding the review cap timed out; the reversible assumption is to checkpoint the validated fix and continue. If the owner requests another review, review this final delta without rewriting history.

Residual behavior remains explicit: with no trustworthy provider turn identity, failure cleanup refuses to interrupt an unknown turn, which can leave that provider request waiting. Live app/UI/provider acceptance, performance and a full-root test campaign were not run. Optional presentation/retention items remain deferred in the reviewer evidence; no unqualified process-registry or Resume behavior is enabled.

## Main verification before R2

Frozen source/test snapshot: `70ee3c8bdb05a833bb4fb826d72ae7c9616c3040`, against R1 `0cabecc5cb118849e687f097782d226109d6eb3f`; 69 intended source/test paths, with the unrelated Codemap helper excluded. Main independently confirmed the final compile, lint, question-persistence and startup-reconciliation tickets above all completed with exit 0. Main read the hand-over pending-write gate, persisted recovered-outcome creation and catalog reconciliation. The running-job list and real Git index were empty.

Main reproduced and corrected its two R1 evidence Scope headers, then reran `Scripts/check-agent-context`, `make guardrails` and scoped `git diff --check`: all passed, with the existing route-count warning only. This supersedes the worker's header-failure report; no source changed. Both lanes received the same R2 delta and current supporting files, with only their own prior findings/dispositions. R2 results are not yet recorded here.

## Main verification before R1

Frozen source/test snapshot: `0cabecc5cb118849e687f097782d226109d6eb3f`, against initial review tree `923f69a840be1fc0e297e8eb80dade18c1ecec92`. It includes 67 intended source/test paths; the unrelated Codemap helper and all original unrelated changes are excluded. The real index remained empty. Both independent lanes received the same complete delta and supporting current files, each with only its own prior findings and dispositions.

Main inspected the answer-preservation success guard, Codex native-question ownership and result checks, ordinary terminal outcome reconciliation, durable closed-draft projection, current-launch run projection and provider-loss call sites. Conductor independently confirmed exit 0 for the final compile, lint, 22 reset-boundary tests and 52 Codex-liveness tests above. The running-job list was empty. Main ran `make guardrails`, `Scripts/check-agent-context` and scoped `git diff --check`; all passed, with the existing 24-route warning only. This does not qualify real app or provider behavior.

## Unrun limits

- **Not run:**
  - a full-root campaign;
  - visual or UI rendering of the banner, sheet, and sidebar button;
  - the visible app (launch, crash, relaunch);
  - real providers or credentials;
  - performance;
  - `make guardrails` or pre-commit.
- **Context check:** `Scripts/check-agent-context` now passes, after main linked this file. It still warns about the existing AGENTS.md route count.
- **Not covered by tests:**
  - the SwiftUI layer: the menu `Button`, `WindowStatesManager` window selection and `openNewMainWindow`, and the sheet host's `onAppear`/`onReceive` presentation. The router and request semantics are covered without a visible window.
- **Index-only schedule limits:**
  - Index summaries now carry the attempt ID (A F08). An index entry without one (written before this change, or for a schedule with no attempt) offers Open but no Dismiss (R1). Its hold filter still matches by schedule ID only.
  - A schema-7 index is read for schedules only (B F4); older schemas still give "couldn't be checked".
  - A schedule changed on disk is seen only after the next index write and a refresh trigger.
- **Live acceptance:** O3 is pending. These are fixture and stub results, not real-app crash or provider acceptance.
- **Allowlist:** main added the Phase 2 evidence paths to `Scripts/source_layout_guardrails.sh`.
