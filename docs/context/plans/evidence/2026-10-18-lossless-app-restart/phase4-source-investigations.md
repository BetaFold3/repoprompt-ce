# Phase 4 bounded source investigations

Scope: read when the task touches older saved-input canonical ownership or Claude native identity after the inactive lossless-restart checkpoint.

Last-verified: 2026-10-22

## Outcome and scope

O10's two source-only investigations are complete. Neither implements or qualifies recovery. The older-message contract, normal-live Claude merge and full Phase 4 remain blocked. Production registry, Stop, fresh-Claude-ID, Resume/history and automated Restart remain OFF; O3 live acceptance is pending.

The owner's notes and O10 were first persisted in signed local commit `206bcbf95353fc3de107114dc5b54ac66d6ee1cf` (six files, documentation plus three exact evidence allowlist entries). The production source under investigation remains the inactive partial checkpoint `fbc1ef041cd7000255c102f7abd7e2464120fe25`.

Read-only workers:
- Older input: session `A3EFFAB5-63E9-4587-B3DF-04C04DA2FB92`, run `FD80746A-90F1-4A08-9C61-FAB754D8420A`.
- Claude identity: session `018CC46A-FE3B-4237-98F9-20CBE2D55324`, run `42D2A7E6-51AA-4BF2-BF7C-D352FB1E966D`. Initial full result is local `prompt-exports/agent-run-018cc46afe3b-1fcca948.md`; a follow-up in the same session checked only official public protocol sources.
- Both completed. Neither edited files, started another worker/Oracle, ran tests, inspected user runtime data, executed a provider or changed activation. Main read their complete results and spot-checked the load-bearing references below. Reports are evidence claims, not authority.

## Older saved input: confirmed source behavior

1. `AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryActions.swift:412-477` searches canonical request anchors, mid-turn user activities and working suffix copies, then refuses an older shown message. `AgentModeViewModel.swift:16898-16934,17428-17440` checks synchronously and reuses a latest bubble without duplicating it.
2. The runtime anchor is not output routing. Main read `AgentModeViewModel.swift:4321-4347`: it chooses the assistant row for the “Worked for” footer. Ordinary live output updates a streaming row or appends to the suffix (`:19399-19475,19916-19931,20010-20023`); Codex also uses its native item scope (`CodexAgentModeCoordinator.swift:6445-6485`).
3. This reaches canonical grouping in the real refresh path, not just an unused legacy helper. Main read the incremental/fallback calls at `AgentModeViewModel.swift:12017-12051,12127-12134`. `AgentTranscriptServices.swift:3311-3316,3376-3391` orders source rows and starts turns from user items.
4. `AgentTabSession.swift:43-46` expressly limits `items` to the mutable full-detail suffix. Main read `AgentTranscriptServices.swift:2758-2787`: working-turn replacement preserves every non-full canonical turn. A suffix remove-and-append cannot delete a canonical-only older occurrence.
5. Main read structural trimming at `AgentTranscriptServices.swift:6360-6410`: non-full spans keep only the conclusion activity, so older mid-turn user placement can disappear. The eligibility selector at `:6092-6106` has no recovery-intent-specific protection. This is not proof that every queued input reaches that state.
6. Main read `AgentRecoveryModels.swift:475-503,915-916` and `AgentRecoveryStore.swift:1930-1959`: payload, origin, deterministic user-item ID, creation time and the submission-ordered intent array survive independently. There is no explicit original transcript sequence/turn/span placement member in that intent shape.
7. Main read the existing fenced canonical save entry at `AgentSessionDataService.swift:2443-2480`. It is the authority to reuse, not a second transcript store. The worker located paired projection installation at `AgentModeViewModel.swift:12758-12794` and canonical save preparation at `:14663-14700`; those deeper call sites still need implementation-specific verification before a patch.

### Concrete failure of the smaller-looking suffix patch

Suppose conclusively unsent A remains as a compacted canonical request, followed by accepted B and C with their own output. Only B/C remain in the working suffix. Removing A from the suffix removes nothing; appending A under its same ID creates another placement while the rebuild preserves old A. Reusing old A without relocating instead leaves later C as the trailing request for newly appended output. Either duplication or wrong request ownership is possible.

For an erased mid-turn A, the recovery intent can reconstruct the payload and identity, but cannot recover its discarded exact old sequence/span placement. Flattening only surviving rows is not reconstruction of canonical history.

### Feasible direction, not implemented safety

A targeted detach-and-tail operation within the existing canonical owner is plausible. It must remove only the saved unsent user's authoritative placement/projections, preserve unrelated request/output/tool state and references, create the same user item at its new execution sequence, repair affected turn envelopes/summaries/frontier, persist through the existing owner, verify that save, then revalidate and use normal dispatch. No existing helper in the inspected chain implements that complete operation. This is a bounded-search conclusion, not a repository-wide proof of API absence.

Do not silently discard the old turn envelope if it owns notices, output, interruption or checkpoint references. Avoid duplicate turn/item identity when old envelope state must remain. Future pinning against compaction does not repair already compacted history.

Existing regression seams to reuse if a patch is selected:
- `AgentRecoveryVMProducerAdmissionTests.swift:786,832-895,900` (reused bubble cleanup, canonical lookup and refusal).
- `AgentModeViewModelInactiveRefreshTests.swift:196` (retention reconciliation).
- `AgentTranscriptRawInputReuseLifecycleTests.swift:161` (cold/warm derivation).
- Add only the missing behavioral cases: request/activity/canonical-only/compacted placements; B/C ownership unchanged; failed save/stale target/duplicate click; reload between relocation and handoff; zero bytes when proof is absent. No new test framework is indicated.

## Claude: confirmed local evidence

- The shipped pre-byte baseline producer saves dispatch/user IDs plus file identity/offset, verifies its receipt, then seeds the cursor (`AgentModeViewModel+RecoveryActions.swift:708-748`). It is not native-user association.
- Main read the package encoder at `ClaudeSDKProtocolCodec.swift:189-206`: it sends text and session ID, not the local user UUID. The controller writes before local turn tracking (`ClaudeNativeProcessSessionController.swift:955-960`); its returned local turn UUID is not provider acceptance evidence.
- Main read `ClaudeSDKNDJSONTranslator.swift:916-923`: live tool-use strings map to translator-local random UUIDs. The raw tool-use string is not retained on the demonstrated result DTO.
- The bridge carries only currently available result fields (`ClaudeCompatibleProviderRuntimeBridge.swift:254-295`); content/tool results lack a proven native JSONL row/block association. The worker traced controller stream emission through `ClaudeIntegratedAgentModeRunner.swift:388-399,732-733` to the actual app reducer.
- Main read `AgentModeViewModel.swift:19399-19475`: live content buffers/merges and final content can replace a trailing assistant row. The tool reducer can replace a call with its result under one local item ID (`:19564-19590`). These are not one-native-row/one-local-item guarantees.
- Main read history projection `ClaudeSessionHistoryReader.swift:632-684`: import IDs derive from provider/session/entry UUID/kind/block ordinal; native user-text rows have nil local identity; import tool invocation IDs are deterministic from tool-use identity. These do not match live random identities by construction.
- Main read captured stdout fixture `ClaudeNativeUsage/2.1.268-child.jsonl:3-9`: two assistant envelopes share API `message.id` but have different envelope UUIDs; user envelopes can represent a child prompt or tool result. This defeats API-message-ID-only and first-user-text heuristics. It is stdout evidence, not a paired native-file trace.
- Main read `ClaudeSessionHistoryReaderTests.swift:5-11,209-227`: history fixtures are explicitly constructor-derived, not live qualification. Whole candidates reject file-history snapshots/system/sidechain/compaction metadata. `ClaudeSessionHistoryReader.swift:294-319` validates every complete line before applying its cursor. Ordinary native-file viability remains unproved by the scoped fixtures; stdout metadata does not prove native-file metadata.
- Main re-read `ClaudeSessionHistoryReader.swift:331-350` and `AgentProviderHistoryImport.swift:97-125`: known keys suppress rows. A partial local “Hel” plus a native final “Hello” must not become “already fully imported” merely because identity was associated. Any later solution needs partial-to-final materialization semantics, not only IDs.

### Official public protocol evidence, checked 2026-10-22

The follow-up found a positive acknowledgement route, so a live observation is not the only conceivable evidence source:

- The [official CLI reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference#cli-flags) documents `--replay-user-messages` as stdin-user acknowledgement on stdout under stream-json input/output. Main verified that entry. It does not explicitly establish equality with persisted native entry identity.
- Official releases [v0.3.265](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/releases/tag/v0.3.265) and [v0.3.269](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/releases/tag/v0.3.269) document UUID-based answered-user attribution, including supplied synthetic input, mid-turn pickup and partial/complete reply surfaces. Main verified those release notes. Attribution of answered users is not the assistant row's identity.
- The official Python native-file reader at pinned revision `3cb0c27eca8caccdc153471a1b19f97fce4ada03` copies a JSONL entry's UUID into its returned session message; main verified [the conversion](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/blob/3cb0c27eca8caccdc153471a1b19f97fce4ada03/src/claude_agent_sdk/_internal/sessions.py#L1146-L1163). A reader is not evidence of how the closed CLI assigns that UUID.

The scoped official lookup did not establish caller UUID = replay acknowledgement UUID = native user-entry UUID, complete assistant envelope UUID = native assistant-entry UUID, or partial-event identity's relationship to a final native row. It also does not qualify the owner's actual shim/version. Do not infer these joins from text, timing, relative file position, SDK field names, checkpoint usefulness or wrapper transport preservation.

### Exact remaining evidence request

Use either an explicit applicable provider contract/writer-source guarantee, or a separately authorized disposable, version-pinned sanitized paired observation:
- one outgoing local input and any identifier-bearing acknowledgement;
- corresponding native JSONL user/output records, including surrounding record types;
- partial and complete stream events with canonical local IDs/content;
- preserved identifier equality/cardinality/block order during sanitization.

A passive matching-text trace cannot establish a positive user join. A paired observation can validate/falsify the relationship for that case, not guarantee every version, merged dispatch, interruption and shim. The protocol/source claim and qualification scope must remain explicit. No logger, schema or generic provenance framework was built.

Minimal future suites depend on the established seam: `ClaudeSDKProtocolCodecTests`, `ClaudeSDKNDJSONTranslatorTests`, `ClaudeCompatiblePluginBridgeTests`, `ClaudeNativeBackgroundTranscriptTests`, `ClaudeSessionHistoryReaderTests`, `AgentRecoveryReconciliationTests`. They were not run for this source-only investigation.

## Product choice, assumptions and deferred work

Main asked the owner whether Send saved may move/reconstruct the same unsent bubble at the current conversation end, preserving ID/payload/saved chronology and unrelated history, and leave it unsent there after a failed dispatch. Alternatives were original-position targeted insertion or deferral. The question timed out after 303 seconds with no selection. No new owner Decision was recorded.

For further reversible planning only, main's recommended assumption is same-ID move/reconstruction with commit-before-handoff and no rollback of the visible relocation on a pre-handoff refusal. This is not approved product behavior, implemented source or permission for live work. Before selecting a patch, resolve old-envelope identity/reference preservation and complete historical coverage; do not call the full requirement done with a suffix-only subset.

Automated Restart stays deferred rather than changing the unresolved-arm failure contract. Main re-read production qualification at `AgentProcessRegistrySupport.swift:58-96` and `AgentRecoveryActionRunner.swift:23-53`: all-pairs registry activation and the shared Continue/Send/Answer action gate are unchanged. Fixtures cannot activate either. O3 live acceptance, provider execution, runtime-data inspection and visible app actions remain unapproved.

## Maintainer-guidance check

- User invariant: no copied/lost saved input, wrong-request output, duplicate answer or omitted partial tail.
- Confidence: source ownership/compaction/identity gaps are confirmed in the inspected paths; same-ID canonical relocation is plausible, not proven safe; native protocol joins are unknown.
- Authority: existing recovery store/coordinator, canonical session owner/DataService and provider protocol; no parallel authority.
- State safety: preserve all unrelated history, fence stale sessions, commit before bytes, keep association distinct from full materialization.
- Scale/observability: one explicit-action canonical operation, not per-event scans or a new service/logger.
- Recommended scope: source evidence complete; next is a bounded conditional canonical design and exact external identity evidence, not speculative implementation or activation.
- Validation boundary: static reads and primary-source lookup only; neither fixture safety nor live behavior was exercised.

## Validation and checkpoint

Notes/decision persistence ran `Scripts/check-agent-context`, all 23 `Scripts/test-check-agent-context` cases, `make guardrails`, `.githooks/pre-commit` and staged whitespace checks successfully. The existing 24-route warning remains. The first staged raw-response whitespace check failed; Markdown hard breaks in OracleE's local copy were converted to explicit line-break markup, and the staged check passed before signed commit `206bcbf9`. Original tool exports remain unchanged.

No Swift source, tests, package definitions, production gates, frozen ledger or release metadata changed. No build, root test, provider/helper/MCP execution, packaging, app lifecycle, signalling, home/credential inspection, performance campaign, new Oracle review, push or history rewrite ran. This evidence adds no new owner Decision and does not reopen the capped Phase 4 review. Documentation-only evidence needs no new behavioral review.

For the completed investigation evidence, main reran the context checker and all 23 checker tests, staged the exact five intended documentation/allowlist paths, read the complete staged diff, and passed `make guardrails`, `.githooks/pre-commit` and the staged whitespace check. Only the existing route-count warning remained. Worker polling and scoped session listings confirmed both workers completed, with no running or waiting-for-input children. Original unrelated dirt remains excluded.

Checkpoint signing attempt failed with `1Password: failed to fill whole buffer` and `failed to write commit object`; HEAD stayed at the signed notes commit. O8 permits a per-invocation unsigned fallback, used for this documentation-only findings checkpoint without changing signing configuration or rewriting history.
