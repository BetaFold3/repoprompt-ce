# Lossless restart — Phase 1 scope and identity assumptions

Scope: read when the task touches the Phase 1 implementation split or durable lifecycle authority for lossless app restart.
Authority: Reference
Last-verified: 2026-10-20

This is implementation evidence for [the plan](../../2026-10-18-lossless-app-restart-spec.md), not an owner Decision or a rewrite of its requirements.

## Owner question and reversible assumptions

The main agent asked the owner two questions after scoped inspection and an OracleA planning consultation. The question timed out after 300 seconds with neither answer supplied. Under the review policy, reversible local implementation may continue on the recommendation.

- **Assumed scope:** Phase 1a contains the 10-second transcript save-request deadline and buffered-text draining only. Both lifecycle flush passes and window-close input preservation move together into Phase 1b, with durable input, admission freezing, and the complete reversible/irreversible shutdown contract. No temporary best-effort shutdown guarantee is introduced.
- **Assumed identity:** `AgentSessionDataService` alone assigns durable lifecycle identity in an optional version-7 session member. Transcript reset and reset identity commit in one atomic session replacement. Durable deletion tombstones fence an incarnation before unlink. Recovery records reference this identity; they do not advance a second authority.
- These assumptions may be revised before the relevant implementation commit. After a local commit, changing course requires an ordinary follow-up change, not a history rewrite. No visible app lifecycle action is authorized by either assumption.
- Owner decision O3 still defers real-app crash testing. Live acceptance must not be inferred from isolated tests.

## Why the split changes

Phase 1a's transcript serialization cannot preserve drafts or queues that have no persisted representation until Phase 1b. Current quit calls `signalTermination` before asynchronous shutdown (`Sources/RepoPrompt/App/AppDelegate.swift:256–277`), while `WindowState.beginClose` tears down observers and feature owners irreversibly (`Sources/RepoPrompt/App/WindowState.swift:303–327`). Failure-vetoing lifecycle flushes therefore belong with Phase 1b's admission freeze and two-stage UI, not behind today's irreversible boundary.

The smaller first step still fixes a directly measured defect: continuous transcript changes can perpetually postpone the one-second save debounce. It does not claim lossless quit, queued-input recovery, or restored drafts.

## Why embedded lifecycle identity

`AgentSessionPersistenceStamp` and reset/deletion generations are process-local (`Sources/RepoPromptAgentCore/AgentMode/Runtime/AgentSessionDataService.swift:21–35,252–276,1269–1309`). R1's assumption of an already durable generation is not satisfied.

The alternative lifecycle sidecar would need a pending/committed reset protocol across two files. Embedding active lifecycle identity makes transcript reset atomic with that identity. Deletion still needs durable tombstones, retained independently of recovery-record cleanup. Compatibility remains decoding-only for older builds; unknown or corrupt lifecycle/tombstone data must fail closed without overwriting it.

Proposed Phase 1b packages, each requiring its own validation and review:
1. Lifecycle model/codec, migration, all session rewrite preservation, reset identity, tombstone-first deletion and reconstruction fences.
2. Recovery storage, durable stub, managed attachment ownership, composer persistence, held-input projection and reconciliation.
3. All intent/receipt handoffs and queue drains together, both Codex acknowledgement producers, scheduled receipt transfer with startup barrier, and crash hold.
4. Complete quit/window-close integration: admission freeze, two flush passes, preserve-versus-withdraw, reversible Stage A, irreversible Stage B, and one absolute deadline.

These are implementation packages, not claims that durable sends are complete before the coupled routes are integrated.

## Shared-writer gate audit

The Phase 0 concern about a load/migration write bypassing the same-session gate was resolved by source inspection:
- Editable load acquires the gate at DataService `:1631`.
- Hydration acquires at `:1669`, commits its storage rewrite at `:1705`, and releases afterward.
- General load acquires at `:2637` before its locked load/storage commit.
- Stub migration acquires at `:2695` before its locked metadata rewrite.
- Full saves, schedule mutations/finalization, and conditional deletion likewise enter the existing session gate before locked loads.

The main agent independently read the editable-load, hydration, general-load and stub-load paths. No writer redesign is indicated by this audit. The private storage-commit helper assumes its caller holds the gate.

## Oracle planning evidence

OracleA's identity was verified (`61D024A4-CCFB-4C9C-A614-CC65E0A1864C`, explicit selection). Planning chat: `restart-phase-1-scope-an-DABF9B`. The local export is `prompt-exports/oracle-plan-2026-10-20-211352-restart-phase-1-scop-bbb2.md`; it supplied the bounded scheduling/drain contract and embedded-identity recommendation. It is not an implementation review. Independent OracleA/OracleB review is still required for each implementation snapshot.
