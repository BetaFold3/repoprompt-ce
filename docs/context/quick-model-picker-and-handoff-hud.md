# Agent Mode quick model picker and handoff HUD

Scope: read when the task touches the Agent Mode quick model picker or quick handoff shortcuts, model-leaf index/ranking, HUD lifecycle or hosting, HUD or new-session composer focus acquisition, snippet-palette shell arbitration, current-session model commit seam, or last-completed-reply handoff routing.

## Durable contract

The feature provides two configurable, window-scoped Agent Mode HUDs:

| Action | Stable shortcut name | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Quick model picker | `showAgentQuickModelSelectionHUD` | ⌥⌘K |
| Quick handoff | `showAgentQuickHandoffHUD` | ⇧⌥⌘K |

Both shortcuts post `.showAgentModelSelectionHUD` with a target `windowID` and stable `AgentModelSelectionHUDMode` raw value. Global shortcut enablement requires an active app, enabled settings, and an exact tracked non-closing main window matching AppKit's native key window. Target resolution is native-key-first with the deferred focus flag only as a routing fallback; the fallback never enables shortcuts. The global coordinator must route HUD actions through `guardedHUDWindowState()`, preserving its latest-window fallback; Settings owns the user-configurable catalog rows.

Quick model picker changes the active session's model. Quick handoff creates a new session from the newest eligible completed assistant reply and may cross provider families.

## Owning source seams

- Pure catalog flattening and ranking: `Sources/RepoPrompt/Features/AgentMode/Models/ModelSelection/AgentModelSelectionIndex.swift`.
- HUD state, rendering, and presentation-driven focus assertion: `ViewModels/UI/AgentModelSelectionHUDViewModel.swift` and `Views/Components/AgentModelSelectionHUDView.swift`.
- Presentation, live revalidation, and commits: `ViewModels/AgentModeViewModel+ModelSelectionHUD.swift`.
- Shared MCP-only model-control interactivity, current-session commit ordering, cache-only remote catalog access, last-reply lookup, and source-pinned handoff config: `ViewModels/AgentModeViewModel+Handoff.swift`; composer props consume the same predicate in `AgentModeViewModel+ComposerUI.swift`.
- Transcript cutoff policy: `Runtime/Transcript/AgentTranscriptServices.swift`, with shared conclusion repair in `AgentTranscriptQualityRepair.swift`.
- Handoff execution, success-only effort persistence, and error formatting: `Services/AgentHandoffActionSupport.swift`.
- Atomic hosting, blocking-overlay/HUD exclusion, and snippet-palette activation arbitration: `Sources/RepoPrompt/App/Views/ContentRootShellView.swift`.
- New-session composer focus-token carriage and AppKit first-responder delivery: `Sources/RepoPrompt/Features/AgentMode/Views/AgentInputBar.swift` and `Sources/RepoPrompt/Infrastructure/UI/TextField/ResizableTextField.swift`.
- Shortcut activation and target resolution: `App/GlobalShortcutActivation.swift`, `App/WindowStateManager.swift`, and `App/GlobalKeyboardShortcutsCoordinator.swift`; notification and catalog ownership remains in `Infrastructure/Utilities/Shortcuts.swift`, `App/Notifications/AppNotifications.swift`, and `Features/Settings/Views/KeyboardShortcutsSettingsView.swift`.

## Safety and performance invariants

- Presentation snapshots provider/catalog/transcript inputs once. Keystrokes perform only in-memory ranking: no process launch, network request, provider discovery, or remote catalog load.
- Remote HUD presentation uses `cachedRemoteHostCatalog(sourceTabID:)`, backed by `remoteHostCatalog.cachedCatalog(for:)`. Do not use an accessor that loads on cache miss.
- The index preserves provider-native raw identifiers and encoded effort behavior. A valid parameterized current Cursor raw remains exact; Fast warnings cover Codex Fast and Cursor `fast=true`.
- Empty-query selection is the exact current leaf only. If none exists, Enter is inert; Down starts at the first row and Up at the last. Digits are query input, never row shortcuts.
- Current-session model controls use the existing MCP-only interactivity rule. Available families still come from `selectableAgents(forTabID:)` plus `canSelectAgentInCurrentChat`; do not add run-state, remote, or pending-operation gating.
- `commitCurrentSessionModelSelection` revalidates the source tab, interactivity, family/knowledge policy, and live option existence, then preserves established encoded-effort persistence and model/effort side-effect ordering.
- Handoff presentation and commit are pinned to `sourceTabID`. Local routing uses `prepareHandoffHeadless(sourceTabID:...)`; live source/session/host drift fails closed.
- Handoff may cross provider families but still obeys provider availability and knowledge-session policy. Remote destinations come only from the cached catalog, exclude host default, and require `remoteCoordinator.hostRowID(for:session, clientItemID:)`.
- Codex native startup classifies start-versus-resume from saved native metadata alone — for handoff destinations and every other local Codex session — never from migrated transcript rows or reconnect flags. Both saved thread ID and rollout path absent (or whitespace-only) starts a new thread; a saved thread ID resumes that thread; a rollout path without its required thread ID is an explicit persisted-state integrity error, and successful start results never persist that shape. Failed first starts retain the pending handoff and retry `thread/start`.
- The last-reply resolver refuses active sessions, skips explicit failed/cancelled turns even when they contain displayable assistant text, accepts legacy nil terminal state, never synthesizes compacted summaries, and uses legacy items only when structured turns are absent.
- Ordinary Escape, click-outside, and dismissal cannot cancel a committing handoff. A blocking overlay—including remote device approval—immediately unmounts the HUD through the non-cancelling suspension path; task completion must not remount stale state.
- Every completed model-selection/handoff HUD presentation, including a cross-mode refresh while mounted, increments a presentation epoch after rebuilding its rows. The view responds with an animation-disabled false→true query-focus edge whose true leg runs on the next main-queue turn outside the insertion transaction and revalidates presentation, epoch, and non-committing phase. Fresh mount, cross-mode presentation, commit-error recovery, and guarded window re-key are the only acquisition sites; same-mode re-press remains a pure toggle-dismiss. The query is disabled only while committing, so an unavailable completed presentation accepts the same focus edge and query input even though its result rows remain disabled.
- HUD focus transfer is owned by that presentation edge. Do not resign first responder in the shell, add an `NSEvent` monitor, or rely on `.defaultFocus`; those paths either strand unavailable presentations or create parallel input routing. This contract currently applies only to the model-selection/handoff HUD, not the navigation HUD.
- User-initiated new-session focus uses one view-local `@State composerFocusToken` and UUID-only `ResizableTextFieldFeatures` plumbing; the token is part of `AgentComposerView`'s custom equality identity and must not move into `AgentComposerProps`. `AgentInputBar` must observe tab ID plus request ID/tab ID through one Equatable cue, not independent `onChange` handlers: coalesced updates could otherwise consume a matching request and then erase its token. The single cue clears on a tab transition before evaluating the new snapshot, preserves consume-at-match, leaves publish-time mismatches pending, and consumes/discards tab-change mismatches. The text-field coordinator seeds mounted tokens without focusing, applies only post-mount token changes on the next main-queue turn, waits for window attachment, drops sheet-blocked or dismantled requests, and revalidates stale deferred work. An already-first-responder text view marks the token applied without another AppKit call; an attempted focus failure is terminal, marks the token applied, and increments a DEBUG diagnostic. App/key-window state is not a gate because `makeFirstResponder` changes only that window's responder chain; the existing SwiftUI focus bindings remain non-authoritative mirrors.
- DEBUG `hud-routing` instrumentation is observational only and records command/mode, suppressed resolution, non-nil exact native-key classification versus exact focus/latest fallback, and shell `presented` versus same-mode `toggle-dismissed`; it must not change target resolution, notification payloads, shell gates, or routing.
- The navigation HUD, model-selection HUD, and snippet-palette activation are mutually exclusive. A window-scoped public snippet request is accepted only by the exact main-route key window when no sheet or blocking overlay is present and both HUDs are absent; the shell stamps the active compose tab onto the internal activation hop. The composer accepts only an exact window-and-tab scope, revalidates its live key-window/text-view/IME state, then focuses before opening or toggles when already first responder; an active palette is dismissed whenever its configured window/tab scope changes, including to nil.

- Handoff action persistence/error formatting: `make dev-test FILTER=AgentHandoffUITests`.
- Codex handoff first-send and native start/resume state: `make dev-test FILTER=AgentModeRunServiceLifecycleTests`.
- Shortcut names, defaults, notification, and Settings rows: `make dev-test FILTER=KeyboardShortcutCatalogTests`.
- Remote cached-catalog integration: `make dev-test FILTER=RemoteWorkspaceSidebarTests`.

Always run `make dev-lint` for Swift changes. Run `make dev-build` when changing SwiftUI hosting, shortcut registration, notifications, or target composition. Run `make guardrails` when moving source or routed context files.
